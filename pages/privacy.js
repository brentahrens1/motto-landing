            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is important to Motto Health, Inc., so we’ve developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we use your personal information. When we use the term “personal information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information about you that is personally identifiable to you.</p>
            <p>In order to understand how we use your personal information, we need to explain Motto’s legal organization. As further described in our Terms of Use, Motto Health, Inc. operates the websites located at www.mottohealth.co and other related websites, web-based applications and mobile applications (“the Site”). An associated but independent group of affiliated clinical practices (“Practices”) provides the licensed professionals who treat Members on the Site. Both Motto Health, Inc. and Practices (collectively, “Motto”, “we”, and “us”) may use and disclose your personal information collected through the Site and other communications between you and Motto, but how we use and disclose that information depends on whether it is health information or another type of personal information. For purposes of clarification, Motto Health, Inc. does not provide any medical or clinical services.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy (our “Privacy Policy”) also describes our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. All capitalized terms in this Privacy Policy not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Service.</p>
            <p>We believe that your health information should have heightened privacy protections, which is also required by federal and state laws. All collection, use, and disclosure of your health information through the Site is governed by Practice’s Health Information Privacy Policy. When you create an Account and log in to the Site using your Account Information, you access a secure patient portal. We treat all health information that you provide when creating an Account and in the patient portal as health information under Practice’s Health Information Privacy Policy. That means if we need to collect, use, or disclose that health information for any reason, we follow the Health Information Privacy Policy. Please review the Health Information Privacy Policy for more information on how we protect your health information and your rights under applicable laws.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect:</p>
